Day 1: Setup with github:

to create venv virtual env:
conda create -p venv python==3.8 -y

to activate the venv 
conda activate venv/

then use git commands to clone and push

git init
git commit -m "First Commit"
git branch -M main 
git remote add origin https://github.com/vanshuwjoshi/MLProjects.git
git push -u origin main

then create a .gitignore file in github for python
to update our local evn we can use "git pull". This will add .gitignore file in our system as well

Create two new files: setup.py and requirement.txt
requirement.txt will have all the packages that we need to install.
and with setup.py we will be able to build our ML app as a package.

Inside requirement.txt write down the packages required and at the end write "-e ." this will trigger the setup.py 

Complete the setup.py as done

Create a src folder and create a __init__.py file as well.

Now "pip install -r requirement.txt" this will install all the packages in requirement.txt and trigger the setup.py file to make our project as a package.

Now commit and push your changes.
